# learningKotlin
In this repository I will post my progress of learning Kotlin language. Before Kotlin, I got knowledge in Java Core, so I think this experience will help me in learning this language.

If you want to check some basics of Kotlin - open MainActivity.kt file. For your comfort, I leave comments in file. Hope, they will help you.
